I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, 
and a BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like superheroes, puzzles and Lego; Wordle is okay too, I guess. This
is the way.

Porsche dealership. I enjoy hard sci-fi novels, the beach, and kayaking.
I also love japanese fusion jazz, check out Casiopea and T-Square, great for
driving.

reading high fantasy. If you're into books, definitely check out anything 
written by Brandon Sanderson.
