I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, 
and a BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like superheroes, puzzles and Lego; Wordle is okay too, I guess. This
is the way.

I am a junior major of Computer Science with a minor in French. Fantasy novels, video games and linguistics are some of my hobbies. I came to UNCG as a jazz major (upright bass), but thankfully realized I am not a musician. I hope to do a master's in computational linguistics after graduating.
